# Python Example Code

A list of example programming exercises.

1. Factorial
    Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number, n.  Factorial is defined as:

    `n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1`

    Keep in mind that 1! = 1 and 0! = 1, and for this exercise, n is always >=0.

2. Longest Word

    `ocean is big water => water big is ocean`

5. Reverse Each Word
    Write a program to accept input from the user and reverse the character order of each word.

    `ocean is big water => naeco si gib retaw`
